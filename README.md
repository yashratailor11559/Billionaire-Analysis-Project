# Billionaires Statistics Analysis

This project focuses on exploring global billionaire statistics using data analysis, SQL integration, and Power BI visualization. It highlights key insights into wealth distribution, industries, economic factors, and more.



 Project Overview

- Perform **Data Cleaning** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Store and query cleaned data using **SQL (MySQL with SQLAlchemy)**
- Build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for visual insights

 Dataset Features

The dataset includes:
- Billionaire personal details (name, birth, title, state)
- Economic indicators (GDP, CPI, Life Expectancy, Tax, etc.)
- Education, Wealth Source (self-made or inherited), and more


 Data Analysis Report
- EDA with key statistics and correlations
- Industry and economic factor analysis
- Visualizations of trends in wealth

 Wealth Distribution
- Histogram/Box plot of net worth
- Regional wealth comparisons

 Industry Analysis
- Most common industries among billionaires
- Source of wealth: self-made vs inherited

Self-Made vs Inherited Wealth
- Pie chart/bar chart analysis
- Country/industry-specific patterns

Economic Factors
- GDP vs Population
- Tax Rate vs GDP
- CPI and Life Expectancy correlations

Visualizations
- Bar, Pie, Line, and Map visuals
- Interactive slicers: Country, Industry, Age, Gender

 SQL Integration
- Load data using SQLAlchemy
- Run queries for insights: average wealth, counts, correlations

 Power BI Dashboard
- Clean, interactive layout with slicers
